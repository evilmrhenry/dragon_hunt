Dragon Hunt 3.57

Changed:
Fixed a bad bug in the overworld map. The far south and east will now display
properly. (Elena of Valhalla for report.)
Corrected a spell buying message. (Elena of Valhalla for report.)

Requirements:
Recent version of Python, and Pygame. This game should work on Linux,
Windows, and Mac OSX (and any other OS that supports Python and Pygame) as
long as the preceeding requirements are met. However, all development was done
in Linux, so glitchs may be present in OSX and Windows.

Running the game:
on Linux, running the shell script "Dragon_Hunt_Linux" will start the game. On
other platforms, type "python rpg.py" from the code directory.

Playing the game:
Keyboard default buttons:
Use the arrow keys to move, enter for actions, and esc for leaving a screen.

Mouse:
Click in the direction you want to move. All buttons/lists/etc should work as
expected.

Shortcuts:
i (or Enter): opens the inventory from the main screen
s: saves in main screen
q: quits in main screen
a: attacks in battle
